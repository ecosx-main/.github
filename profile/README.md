The ECOSX (Open Source Chip Ecosystem) Team is committed to building open source chip design solutions and its technological ecosystem, using the "open source" concept to innovate chip design methods and realize the ultimate vision of **"lowering the threshold of chip design with open source and empowering thousands of industries"**. The name of ECOSX is taken from the first letters of EDA, Chip, One Student One Chip, System and X (represents exploring unknown fields). In addition, the first four letters in the name are the abbreviation of Ecosystem, which means **"building chip ecosystem"**, and the last four letters are the abbreviation of the cosine function in trigonometric function, which means "**using rigorous methods to explore chip ecosystem"**.
